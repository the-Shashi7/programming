/*
What is Segmentation Error ?
â€“ It is the runtime error caused because of the memory access violation. For Eg :-Stackoverflow, read violation etc..
We often face this problem when working out with pointers in c++/c.
In this example we will see how to find the segmentation error in the program. We will find which lines causes the 
segmentation fault error.

//arr is an integer pointer (int*) which points the first element of the array.
//&arr is an integer array pointer (int*)[5] which points the whole array.
